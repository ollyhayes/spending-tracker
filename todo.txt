todo:
		fix up psuedo code above
		simplify account status
		fix mutligle submissions
		next and previous form element buttons on keyboard
		defocus on submit
		use refresh token to get new access token when it expires
	bring gapi in with webpack (or at least handle it not loading properly)
	get sheet-updater to autofill the autofill columns and sort the table by date and time https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/reference/rest/v4/spreadsheets/request#autofillrequest
		disallow submit without category or number
	minify bunudle
	get rid of autocomplete on text boxes
	animation on submit
		numbers in currenty box
	add temporary message
		allow updating spreadsheet
		create multimanager and get crap out of index
		switch to using mobx
	make children of multimanager private
		have method on multimanager handle result of trySync, and do queued stuff syncs
		remove outer border if up against side
	rename categories for multiline buttons

	try creating special components so we don't have to manipulate elements directly in input-form
		like how custom bindings worked in knockout

		in knockout we would do:
			<category-button data-on-click-focus-on="amount-button"/>
			<amount-input data-focus-id="amount-button" data-on-enter-focus-on="description-button"/>
			<description-input data-focus-id="description-button"/>

		in react we could do:
			<FocusNext
				focusNext="amount-button"
				focesWhen="click">
				<category-button>
			</FocusNext>
			<FocusNext
				focusNext="description-button"
				focesWhen="enter">
				<amount-button data-focus-id="amount-button">
			</FocusNext>
			<description-button data-focus-id="description-button">
