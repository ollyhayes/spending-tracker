todo:
	fix horizontal alignment of text input feilds on iphone - display block and margin auto don't work
	favicon - baht symbol?
	fix google oauth message saying app isn't verified by google
	better font?
	allow custom spreadsheet

	try creating special components so we don't have to manipulate elements directly in input-form
		like how custom bindings worked in knockout

		in knockout we would do:
			<category-button data-on-click-focus-on="amount-button"/>
			<amount-input data-focus-id="amount-button" data-on-enter-focus-on="description-button"/>
			<description-input data-focus-id="description-button"/>

		in react we could do:
			<FocusNext
				focusNext="amount-button"
				focesWhen="click">
				<category-button>
			</FocusNext>
			<FocusNext
				focusNext="description-button"
				focesWhen="enter">
				<amount-button data-focus-id="amount-button">
			</FocusNext>
			<description-button data-focus-id="description-button">
