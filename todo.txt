todo:
	past expenses:
		show date or time not both
		horizontal padding on cells
		fix height of settings page
		reverse order
		fix stepped tr border on sync tick
	can't sign out and in as someone else
	fix multitab bug - check localstorage all the time
		show debug information on request
		remove unused icons from sprites.svg
	test whether it would be quicker to just sort the last x rows instead of all of them
	some sort of timeout on the account init - it just stays loading for ages on iphone and sometimes android
	fix horizontal alignment of text input feilds on iphone - display block and margin auto don't work
		scroll to top after submiting so you can see the status change
		change title to spending tracker
		fix up psuedo code above
		simplify account status
		fix mutligle submissions
		next and previous form element buttons on keyboard
		defocus on submit
		use refresh token to get new access token when it expires
		bring gapi in with webpack (or at least handle it not loading properly)
		get sheet-updater to autofill the autofill columns and sort the table by date and time https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/reference/rest/v4/spreadsheets/request#autofillrequest
		disallow submit without category or number
		minify bunudle
		improve messages - "uploading data" instead of loading etc
		remember past expenpeses and show them in table so we can see if there are concurrency problems - https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/36760568
	call reloadAuthResponse if we get a 403 (or whatever the invalid access token is)
		extract vendor code
	animation on submit
		numbers in currenty box
	add temporary status messages
	favicon - baht symbol?
	fix google oauth message saying app isn't verified by google
		allow updating spreadsheet
		create multimanager and get crap out of index
		switch to using mobx
	make children of multimanager private
		have method on multimanager handle result of trySync, and do queued stuff syncs
		remove outer border if up against side
	rename categories for multiline buttons
	better font?
	see if we can auto fill the entire page on the currency conversion stuff, so that it doesn't matter if the second request gets lost
		not sure if we need the above, it seems to have never happened

	try creating special components so we don't have to manipulate elements directly in input-form
		like how custom bindings worked in knockout

		in knockout we would do:
			<category-button data-on-click-focus-on="amount-button"/>
			<amount-input data-focus-id="amount-button" data-on-enter-focus-on="description-button"/>
			<description-input data-focus-id="description-button"/>

		in react we could do:
			<FocusNext
				focusNext="amount-button"
				focesWhen="click">
				<category-button>
			</FocusNext>
			<FocusNext
				focusNext="description-button"
				focesWhen="enter">
				<amount-button data-focus-id="amount-button">
			</FocusNext>
			<description-button data-focus-id="description-button">
