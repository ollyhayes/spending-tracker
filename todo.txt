todo:
	test whether it would be quicker to just sort the last x rows instead of all of them
	optional animation
	optional blur
	optional autosync
	add other statuses to settings page
	can't sign out and in as someone else
	fix horizontal alignment of text input feilds on iphone - display block and margin auto don't work
	call reloadAuthResponse if we get a 403 (or whatever the invalid access token is)
	animation on submit
	add temporary status messages
	favicon - baht symbol?
	fix google oauth message saying app isn't verified by google
	make children of multimanager private
	rename categories for multiline buttons
	better font?
	see if we can auto fill the entire page on the currency conversion stuff, so that it doesn't matter if the second request gets lost

	try creating special components so we don't have to manipulate elements directly in input-form
		like how custom bindings worked in knockout

		in knockout we would do:
			<category-button data-on-click-focus-on="amount-button"/>
			<amount-input data-focus-id="amount-button" data-on-enter-focus-on="description-button"/>
			<description-input data-focus-id="description-button"/>

		in react we could do:
			<FocusNext
				focusNext="amount-button"
				focesWhen="click">
				<category-button>
			</FocusNext>
			<FocusNext
				focusNext="description-button"
				focesWhen="enter">
				<amount-button data-focus-id="amount-button">
			</FocusNext>
			<description-button data-focus-id="description-button">
